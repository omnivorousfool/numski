# order(numski)

## A game compiled by Python with GUI made by tkinter.
  
This game is **still uncomplete** as its settings page is unfisihed, but that doesn't matter.

Almost **no comments** in these codes, but there would be enough comprehensive comments in the future.

## **Requirements**:

* Python 3.x (3.7 recommended)

* supported OS: **Windows**

* no 3rd party packages required and make sure tkinter is installed
